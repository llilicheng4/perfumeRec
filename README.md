# Book Recommendation System (BookRecs)

This project is a Perfume recommendation service that suggests perfumes based on a user's inputs. It's built upon a database of 5000 perfumes. By self-hosting sentence-transformers to generate vectors and stored weaviate db

## ðŸ’« Features

- Input genre and book titles to get book recommendations
- Vector Search on Weaviate Vector database of 7000 books
- Jupyter Notebook workflow to access and store vector embeddings in Weaviate
- Responsive design, thanks to TailwindCSS

## ðŸ›  Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/weaviate/BookRecs.git
   ```

2. Optionally, create a Weaviate Cluster using the [Weaviate Console](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) and make note of the cluster URL and the API Key. The project is already configured to read from an existing Weaviate Cluster. If you choose not to create a new Weaviate Cluster, you can rely on the default cluster we've already created for you. It's configured in both the NextJS app and the Python data pipeline. 

3. Create a OpenAI account and create API Key.

4. Set up environment variables in .env
   ```
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required. If you don't choose not to create the Weaviate Cluster, remove `WEAVIATE_CLUSTER_URL` and `WEAVIATE_API_KEY` from the `.env`.

5. Set up a Python virtualenv to populate your vector database and to experiment with semantic search. 
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv 
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python data-pipeline/populate.py # Will only work if you create your own cluster
   python data-pipeline/search.py
   ```

6. Install dependencies
   ```
   cd bookrecs
   npm install
   ```
7. Run the app
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
8. Try out BookRecs in a browser at http://localhost:3000


## ðŸ§° Usage

To use the service, simply type in a genre and several book titles in the provided input fields. The system will then generate several book recommendations based on your inputs.

You can try this at https://bookrecs.weaviate.io

You must set at least on OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable. You can also set up your own Weaviate cluster and create embeddings yourself. If you choose not to do this, BookRecs will use a Read Only API key for an existing Weaviate cluster containing the Kaggle dataset. 


## ðŸ’¾ Data Source

The book data used for this project is sourced from the following Kaggle dataset: [7k books with metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dylanjcastillo/7k-books-with-metadata). The dataset has been converted to a vector embedding using the sentence-transformer model for improved natural language processing and stored in a Weaviate clustor for fast vector lookups.
